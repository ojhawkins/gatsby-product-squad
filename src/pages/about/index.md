### Hi, I’m Julia the product gal

I’m a product nerd who loves to build and launch new digital products & experiences for people.

I’ve been working in product for about 7 years both in large established organisations and start ups and have launched two successful digital financial products.

I am here to start a community of passionate product peeps to share insights, learnings and tips!

If you are an aspiring product manager, already a product manager, or just super interested in all things products, get in touch! Let’s collaborate!
